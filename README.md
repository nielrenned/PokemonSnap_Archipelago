## Pokémon Snap Archipelago AI Usage Disclosure
- Pokémon Snap Archipelago is **not** vibe-coded.
- Pokémon Snap Archipelago does **not** contain AI art.
- Conversations with LLMs have been used to gain insights about the repository and brainstorm ideas for improvements. All ideas and insights pitched by LLMs are read by a human before being implemented. Generally, all new code by me, [@nielrenned](https://github.com/nielrenned), is handwritten and hand-tested.
- The [repository that this was forked from](https://github.com/gerbiljames/PSAP) **did** use LLMs to generate some code that is in the patch file. The amount of code that was LLM-generated vs. by a human is unknown. The generated code has been reviewed and tested by multiple humans. All that code is contained in the commit on `main` with short hash `771f72d`.
